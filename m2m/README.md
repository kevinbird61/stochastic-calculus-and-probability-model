# Random Access Problem in Machine-to-Machine

## Talking About Network Modeling

A basic way to build network model:
1. Technique background (From `paper` ,technical essay, magazine ... etc)
2. System model (Mathematic & Question-Defined)
3. Simulation (Base on Step 1,2 to construct `program`)
4. Analysis (Measure the result from program)

Base on this four method, we can easily define our question and find an efficient way to locate and find the answer.

## Technique Background

## System Model 

## Simulation 

## Analysis
